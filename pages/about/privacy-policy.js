                                    A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server to uniquely identify your browser or to store information in your browser. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. A “web beacon” links web pages to servers and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Most cookies expire after a certain period of time depending on what they are used for. NftHost.app uses both first-party cookies (which are set by our website when it is being visited) and third-party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our website).
